# Duell
A repository for the Duel Game By Roland Studer. Hopefully One Day Ill Make one of my own.

This can originaly be found here https://sourceforge.net/projects/duell/ 
I had to heavily modify it due to closed source to translate it to english. I wish i could resize the window and maybe link two programs. maybe even get move sugjestions. This game was truly well written especialy for its time. Roland Passed away and a friend of his family did the last update on sourceforge in 2010. I grabbed it and translated it rather messilly to english. Roland came up with an ingenious method of calculating best moves for an "AI" Second player. He was kind enough to Put All of his methodolog into a text file with the exacutable. So I hope to someday make this from scratch and implement his AI in my iteration. Until then I hope someone else out there finds this helpfull.
