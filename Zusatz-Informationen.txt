 Duell is aby PARKER-SPIELE with (c) 1975,
board game releasedbut unfortunatelyfrom the market about 10 years later
withdrawnhas been. PARKER wrote the following regarding the game
: "This game is not easy. It demands thethinking aheadfrom itsages 10+
highest concentration, goodandplayers
skillful tactics. For 2 players,."

 Parker also wrote on the game box:
       Duel - a game of thinking and tactics for 2 players       

 "Duel is a game with dice - but anything but a
dice game. On a playing field of 8 * 9 fields, thebuild
two playerstheir 9 dice each (8 and 1 king
die). The starting positions are precisely prescribed. It is
drawn alternately, the red pieces begin (note
author's: in a computer duel there are no red pieces;there
white beginslike in chess against black) Dice aretilting
moved bythem from space to space.
During a move, you may turn once at right angles
. The length of the move depends on the number
on the top of the die - ie before the
move ( Eg: a 5)
 The unheard-of variety in Duel is due to the
fact that after the move there is a different number on the
top of the die, for example there is the
possibility of a certain Fe Can be reached from two sides
, but each time there is a different number on
the top of the die. "

 Photos of examples are stillon the PARKER game box
printed. In one of the examples, the white
king is threatened by the red 6. "The white king, who can
only move one square at a time, is forced to evade
, otherwise he will be defeated and thus lose the game
. In this example, the white king can move
forward as well as to the right or avoid danger to the left
(author's note: he could also stand still and
be covered by a figure) ".

 So much for the board game from PARKER with its red and white
wooden cubes. Incidentally, on our1984, my wife and I discovered
honeymoon in California inthe game Duel in a
small toy shop in Carmel, also from a company called "Lakeside
"; this was a version with plastic cubes.
In internet research I recentlyfrom "Lakeside Industries
discovered the game with (c) 1976", also with wooden cubes like
the PARKER version. The game box is also the
same as that from PARKER. On this occasion I
printed out the English rules of the "Lakeside" game. There
the players themselves decide who should start a match
, so not necessarily red like at PARKER.

 By the way, Schmidt-Spiele has beenfor a few years now
offering a very similar game called "Tactix", a
successor to Duel, with practically the same rules, including the
same dice, but "unfortunately" with a different field
size ( 9x9 instead of 9x8 fields).

 So much for my remarks on the "Duell board game",which are
some ofstill available on the Internet, sometimes as a "second hand version"
.


 So enthusiastic about the duel board game (among friends and
we played real tournamentsacquaintances),was created in
my first computer version1985 because Iaat all times
wanted to have"play partner". The first version was still written in
the FORTRAN programming language. This was followed by a
mouse-controlled version written in MODULA on the ATARI
computer, which, after studying computer chess books,
already had a "minimax search" and "alpha-beta algorithm" for
"thinking ahead" Computer was equipped. For several
years I have had a GEM emulatoron my Windows PC in
runningorderthe ATARI-DUELL program even without ATARI
to be able to continue using.

 Inspired by the book, published"Galileo Computing"
by Ulrich Kaiserby: "Game programming in C ++",I created
last summera new, Windows-compatible version of the
DUELL program.

 For those interested, some details on the program
structure of DUELL are shown below:
 
 In order to be able to play a duel against the computer,
some tables are necessary, whichin the program under the menu item
Options -> Show settings -> Show expenses with cost and
can be displayedevaluation information.

Example:

C. move: INFORMATION:
        White pieces: Black pieces:
 +1 +1 +1 0 0 0 +1 0 0 +1 +5 +7 0 0 0 +2 0 +2

 For each of the eight(white / black dice)
piecesthe following information is kept in columns,
with the pieces from left towith regard to the starting field
rightts are numbered consecutively (the king isnumbering
skipped whenand listed as number 9 or -9):
1) the figure is still alive (+ 1 = yes / 0 = no)
2) x-position of the die (A. .I corresponds to 1..9)
3) y-position of the die (1..8)
4) = a) Number of attacks on non-defended opposing piecespieces
      (dice) by this figure
5) = b) Number of attacks on coveredOpposing dice by
      this figure
6) = c) Number of duels by this figure (1 = one-way duel / 2 = two-
      way duel)
7) = d) Number of covers by your own figures (incl.by the
      own king)
)8) = e number of attacks on this figure by enemy Figu-
      ren (incl. by the opponent's king)
9) = f) Number of guard duties this figure for the own
      dice

 for the individual king-cube ( white / black) the
following information is kept:
1) the king is still alive (+ 1 = yes / 0 = no)
2) x-position of the king (A..I corresponds to 1..9)
3) y-position of the King's (1..8)
4) = r) Number of attacks on undefended opposing pieces
      (dice) by this King's die
5) = s) Number of attacks on covered opposing dice by
      the King's die
6) = t) Number of attacks on this king's die by opposing
      pieces (= number of duels)
7) = u) Number of protectivethis king's die for one's
      tasks ofown die
8) = v) Number of playing field lines on which only one opposing
      die stands, whereby there is another opposingin the duel distance
      die(-> deduction duel possibility (s))
9) = w) number of playing field lines on which there is only one die of its own
      , whereby in D uell-distance there is another opposingpiece
      die (-> blocked own(s))

 The valuesall still living pieces
a) .. f) are added up individually forand in the table under evaluation
for white or for black as the first six pieces of information
listed. The next three pieces of information for white and black
are the strike potential, the attack potential and the
defense potential of the move.

 For the individual sums from a) .. f), for the individual potentials
, for the values ??r) .. w), but also for the course of the game
, there are so-called cost factors, which
are defined as follows ( fixed values):

for sum a) = 5 for r) = 5
for sum b) = 1 for s) = 1
for sum c) = 6 for t) = -60
for sum d) = 3 for u) = 2
for Sum e) = -4 for v) = -30
for sum f) = 2 for w) = -20

for the impact potential of a move = 40
for the attack potential of a move = 40
for the defense potential of a move = 40

in the starting game (to hold back the king) = -30
(y-value punishment rel. To 1 for white or 8 for black)

in the endgame (to drive the king in the direction = -10 for x
               opposing king square and
               forward) = -10 for y
(x-value penalty rel. To 5 (middle column of the playing field))
(y-value penalty rel. To 8 for white or 1 for black)

 Under evaluation for white or for black in the The
second lines are the ones for the respective train option with
the cost factors weighted values:

1st value: total value calculated from all eight dice
2nd value: total value determined from the relationships of the king
3rd value: sum of the weighted potential values
4th value: cost value depending on the position of the king
5. Value: Total of the costs for white or black.

 The total of the evaluation for the respectiveoption
moveis finally shown in the information tablebottom right
at the. Under 'New =' the difference is formed from the total
costs for white and black, depending on
who is on the move, as 'white minus black' or then 'black
minus white'. From this difference a so-called
compulsory control value (-1000 in a duel and forcingthe hitting of
or avoidingpieces by a threshold when
thinking ahead) can be subtracted. Under 'Alt ='
the cost value of the old train is also displayed, but here with the
opposite sign.

 Finally,is given in the information table in theleft
a short version of the playing field situationlowerhalf
. '0' stands for an empty field, + values
for white cubes, -values ??for black cubes; the first digit
indicates, the second digit the position of
the cube valuethe cube with this value (four positions possible). Since the
king's die is "position-independent" (all four positions are the
same), the second number is 5 (the
first number for the king is always 1).

 In the information table, by the way, in theleft
uppercorner there is a note as to whether the move wasby a person (P. train)
carried out or attemptedor the computer (C. train).

 Finally, my address. If you have any questions
, criticisms or suggestions about the computer game DUEL,
do not hesitate to contact me. I
would love to hear what other people
think of my program and what could be improved.
